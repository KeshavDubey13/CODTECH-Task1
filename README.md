Title: Todo List Project Overview in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Our Todo List project combines JavaScript for dynamic functionality, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling to create an efficient task management tool. Leveraging JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities, we enable users to add, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete seamlessly within the browser.

The HTML structure forms the backbone, defining the layout and elements essential for task entry and display. CSS is employed to ensure a clean and visually appealing interface, enhancing user experience with responsive design principles.

Key features include a user-friendly interface where tasks are displayed with options to categorize and prioritize. JavaScript manages data persistence through local storage, ensuring tasks remain accessible even after browser refreshes.

In terms of functionality, the project allows tasks to be sorted by priority or completion status dynamically. Event listeners and handlers are used to capture user interactions, such as task completion or deletion, providing instant feedback without page reloads.

Future enhancements may include integration with backend services for cloud synchronization, user authentication, and extended collaboration features. This project serves as an excellent foundation for learning front-end web development techniques while delivering practical value in organizing daily tasks efficiently.
